## BACKLOG




# Design
 - Optimize CSS
 - [x] Find better background
 	-  [x] fuzzy background? NO
 - [x]  Footer
 -  [x] Users are displayed differently than ingredients



# Features
 - [ ] When other user(s) selected, reflect their dislikes in the "other" toppings




# Algorithm
 -  [x] events table...track orders
 	-Can then use next step in recommendation by taking past orders of that user(s) and finding out what they're likely to pick
 -  [x] get list of recipes from remaining ingredients.
 	-  [x] remove any recipes with dislikes
 -  [x] keep track of number of dislikes to improve recs for current user(s)
 


# DRY
 - [ ] View fragments inherit common methods from parent instead


# Check on:
 - [ ] Split build rec into two pages?  Users, then other ingredients to avoid?
